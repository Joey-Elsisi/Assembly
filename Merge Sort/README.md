## Assignment:

Your task for the in-lab is to implement the `mergeSort` function in mergeSort.s. This function takes in three parameters. The first parameter is a pointer to an int array. The second parameter is an integer corresponding to the left index in the array. The third parameter is an integer corresponding to the right index in the array.

Sample output:
Below is a sample execution run to show you the input and output format.

```
Enter the array size: 5
Enter value 0: -7
Enter value 1: 2
Enter value 2: -39
Enter value 3: 12
Enter value 4: 8
Unsorted array: -7 2 -39 12 8
Sorted array: -39 -7 2 8 12
```

Additionally a report is included, detailing what I have learned about how objects and parameter passing is implemented in assembly.
